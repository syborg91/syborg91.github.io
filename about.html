  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi 👋🏼 this is Satya.
    <br/><br/>
    I am deeply passionate about programming and always up for indulging in a few thought bubbles over my head. 
    Artificial General Intelligence facinates me : the unexplored recesses of human creativity, the augmentation of our 
    collective intelligence, a universal problem solver in some sense and its implications (ethical or otherwise). The 
    road is long and winding, but I hope that along the way it would provide a window into understanding our own cognition 
    and consciousness.
    <br/><br/>
    In my spare time, I love playing the guitar, video games, listen to a plethora of music and paint occassionally.
