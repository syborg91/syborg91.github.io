  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>
    Hi üëãüèº this is Satya.
    <br/><br/>
    I am deeply passionate about programming, building things and always up for exchanging ideas and indulging in a few thought bubbles. 
    Artificial intelligence facinates me: the unexplored recesses of human creativity, the augmentation of our 
    collective intelligence, a universal problem solver in some sense and its implications (ethical or otherwise). The 
    road is long and winding, but I hope it would provide a window into understanding our own cognition along the way.
    <br/><br/>
    To that end, I work with machine/deep learning paradigms and am currently a Research Fellow at 
    <a href="https://www.monash.edu/business/soda-labs/home">SoDa Laboratories</a>, in the Department of Business and 
    Economics at Monash University. In terms of research, I am working on <a href="https://wba-initiative.org/en/research/rfr/rfr-self-organising-architectures/">Self-organising neural networks hierarchies</a> 
    and applied ML in PolySci domain. I studied Mechanical Engineering and subsequently Data Science for my Bachelors and Masters respectively. In my prior life, I built and shipped predictive models to production.
    <br/><br/>
    In my spare time, you might find me playing the guitar, video games, listening to a plethora of music, reading or very occassionally, sketching. I also love hiking and
    exploring nature in general which is something I wish I have more time for in the future!
    <br></br>
    If you would like to chat or collaborate please feel free to <a href="mailto:{{ site.social.email }}">shoot me an email</a>. Where there are synergies, creativity oft follows.
