              Mammalian brains exhibit functional self-organisation between different neocortical regions to form virtual hierarchies from a 
              physical 2D sheet. We propose a biologically-inspired self-organizing neural network architecture emulating the same. The network 
              is composed of autoencoder units and driven by a meta-learning rule based on maximizing the Shannon entropy of latent representations 
              of the input, which optimizes the receptive field placement of each unit within a feature map. Unlike Neural Architecture Search, here 
              both the network parameters and the architecture are learned simultaneously. In a case study on image datasets, we observe that the 
              meta-learning rule causes a functional hierarchy to form, and leads to learning progressively better topological configurations and 
              higher classification performance overall, starting from randomly initialized architectures. In particular, our approach yields competitive 
              performance in terms of classification accuracy compared to optimal handcrafted architecture(s) with desirable topological features for 
              this network type, on both MNIST and CIFAR-10 datasets, even though it is not as significant for the latter.</p>
